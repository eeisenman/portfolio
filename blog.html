    <p> My perception on robots did not change from today because I am still in debate to myself whether or not robots are safe 
  and good for society and human nature. I hope that robots can help us with accessibility in the future. I'm nervous that most people will
  take advantage of robots and they will rely on it so much that robots will become apart of society. Our circuits worked well and we were able
  to explain how each of the parts worked to make the circuit worked. I wish we could more with the circuits. </p>

    <p> What I really like about this program is that I feel like I am more open to meeting and talking to more people, generally because I work
      better with girls. I also admire the speakers and mentors that help me get a better image on what I want to do in the future. </p>

    <p> Both innovators desire to help the human population in a wat that they don't have to do it themselves. Both of them also worked with human interation with robots. Some of us worked on the code and
      others worked on the robot itself. We worked together to get the lights to work. I wish we were able to add more lights. Pins have to be named. </p>
